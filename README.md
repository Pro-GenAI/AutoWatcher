### Why AutoWatcher:
- Automated threat monitoring is currently not intelligent or
	context-aware based on custom instructions.
- Existing threat prediction models require training data and time.
- This project uses existing models for motion detection and human detection,
	and uses LLMs for real-time context-aware threat prediction.
